#given two strings, s and t, return the words in string s that are NOT in string t
#example s = "I like cheese"
#t = 'like' -> return ['I', 'like']

# s = 'cats hats mats'
# t = 'mats' -> return ['cats', 'hats']

#split t into list
#create a set with list of t words

#split s into list of words
#iterate through list, if set.has is false, add to return list
