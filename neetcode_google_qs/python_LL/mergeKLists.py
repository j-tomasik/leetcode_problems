#iterate through first of each ele to compare, hold pointer for each head's next node
#keep looping through until all three are null, compare and add to main list

#helper func to merge two sorted lists
#main func:
#edge case for not lists or len == 0
#while lists has a len
#for loop through lists arr incrementing by two
#index in at i, and have logic to replace second with None if out of bounds
#run merge lists on the two, append to a temp list that is empty and created in while loop(merged lists)
#re-assign lists to be the merged lists temp arr
#return lists an zero idx once while loop breaks
